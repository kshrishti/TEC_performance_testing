# TIF TEC performance testing data analysis

`tif_data_analysis.py` has all the code to run data analyses on the data collected at the TIF. Please read the documentation for each function! Especially important when running the analysis on annealing cycles because they haven't been studied too much. Also every time you run the algorithm, please plot the plots so that you can manually quickly verify if the algorithm is working as expected - sometimes if the tests aren't smooth you can have unexpected errors. 

The CSV files contain the data from the MTRS that is used in the data analysis algorithm. 

The comprehensive results from all the tests can be found in this slideshow: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DwXDinz7KnUo9X54gPj3rg8sPyi8zOzEJYe-4muieH0/edit?usp=sharing
